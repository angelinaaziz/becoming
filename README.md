## 🌟 The Problem & Solution

### Problem
Personal growth and achievements often go unrecorded, making it hard to visualize progress and document significant milestones in one's journey. Traditional methods lack the permanence and visual evolution that truly showcase personal development.

### Solution
Becoming transforms personal development into a visual journey through a soul-bound NFT that evolves with each milestone. Unlike traditional NFTs, Becoming NFTs:

- Are tied to your identity (non-transferable)
- Evolve visually as you add milestones
- Create a permanent, verifiable record of achievements
- Build a community where achievements are recognized and celebrated

## ✨ Features

| Soul-bound NFT | Visual Evolution | Immutable Records |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tipping System | Community Recognition | Milestone Privacy |

- 🔒 **Soul-bound NFT**: Non-transferable, tied to your identity
- 🎨 **Visual Evolution**: Your avatar evolves through four distinct stages

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Becoming** is built on a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for smooth animations
- **Smart Contract**: Written in ink! (Rust-based smart contract language for Polkadot)
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on Polkadot's Asset Hub (Paseo Testnet)
- **Storage**: Milestone proofs are hashed and referenced on-chain
- **Authentication**: Polkadot.js wallet extension for secure account management

## 💫 Why Polkadot

We chose Polkadot for its robust security, scalability, and developer-friendly environment. The ink! smart contract language provides the safety guarantees of Rust while enabling seamless deployment to Polkadot's ecosystem. With lower transaction costs and cross-chain interoperability, Polkadot offers the perfect foundation for our personal growth NFT platform.
