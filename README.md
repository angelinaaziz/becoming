## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**Becoming** is built on a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for smooth animations
- **Smart Contract**: Written in ink! (Rust-based smart contract language for Polkadot)
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on Polkadot's Asset Hub (Paseo Testnet)
- **Storage**: Milestone proofs are hashed and referenced on-chain
- **Authentication**: Polkadot.js wallet extension for secure account management

## üåê Why Polkadot?

We chose to build Becoming on Polkadot's ecosystem for several compelling reasons:

### Technical Advantages
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: As personal growth transcends boundaries, Polkadot's cross-chain architecture allows Becoming to potentially interact with diverse ecosystems and data sources.
- **Scalability**: Polkadot's parachains and shared security model ensure our application can scale gracefully as our user base grows.
- **Transaction Efficiency**: Low gas fees and fast transaction confirmation times make the small, frequent interactions needed for milestone recording practical and affordable.
- **Future-Proof Infrastructure**: The modular design of Polkadot allows us to adapt and evolve our application without disruptive migrations.

### Developer Experience
- **ink! Smart Contract Language**: ink! provides a Rust-based environment that offers superior safety guarantees compared to other languages, essential for handling personal achievement data.
- **WebAssembly (Wasm) Support**: Enabling efficient, portable smart contracts that can run across different environments.
- **Modern Developer Tooling**: The comprehensive suite of development tools reduces barriers to building sophisticated blockchain applications.

### Ecosystem & Governance
- **Sustainability**: Polkadot's nominated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is environmentally friendly, aligning with our ethos of sustainable personal growth.
- **Community Governance**: The ability for stakeholders to participate in network governance mirrors our vision of community-driven personal development.
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Being part of Polkadot's vibrant ecosystem gives Becoming users access to a broader network of complementary services and applications.

By leveraging Polkadot's unique capabilities, Becoming provides a secure, scalable, and sustainable platform for people to document and share their personal growth journeys.
