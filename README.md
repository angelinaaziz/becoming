## What is Becoming?

Becoming is a decentralized application that transforms personal growth into a visual journey through soul-bound NFTs that evolve with each milestone. Unlike traditional NFTs that are primarily used for trading or collecting, Becoming NFTs are tied to your identity and create a permanent, verifiable record of your achievements. Our platform empowers users to document their personal growth, build a community of support, and celebrate meaningful accomplishments.

## 🌟 The Problem & Solution

### Problem
Personal growth and achievements often go unrecorded, making it hard to visualise progress and document significant milestones in one's journey. Traditional methods lack the permanence and visual evolution that truly showcase personal development.

### Solution
Becoming transforms personal development into a visual journey through a soul-bound NFT that evolves with each milestone. Unlike traditional NFTs, Becoming NFTs:

- Are tied to your identity (non-transferable)
- Evolve visually as you add milestones
- Create a permanent, verifiable record of achievements
- Build a community where achievements are recognised and celebrated

## ✨ Features

| Soul-bound NFT | Visual Evolution | Immutable Records |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tipping System | Community Recognition | Milestone Privacy |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Becoming** is built on a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for smooth animations
- **Smart Contract**: Written in ink! (Rust-based smart contract language for Polkadot)
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on Polkadot's Asset Hub (Paseo Testnet)
- **Storage**: Milestone proofs are hashed and referenced on-chain
- **Authentication**: Polkadot.js wallet extension for secure account management
- **Contract Design**: Custom NFT implementation with soul-bound properties and milestone tracking
- **State Management**: Context API and custom hooks for contract interactions
